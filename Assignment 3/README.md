#  Set Game - Assignment 3 including "extra credit" tasks.

Assignment 3 was building the card game [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)) from scratch using SwiftUI and an MVVM architecture.
I fullfilled the assignment, including the "extra credit" tasks and also added some extra ideas I came up with on my own such as showing a players remaining time by animating their player button filling up.

This assignment practiced working with the MVVM architecture, drawing custom shapes and more.
